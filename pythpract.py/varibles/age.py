#my answer

x = 9
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
d = 40
print(f'you are {x} years old')
print(f'in {a} years, you will be {(x + a)} years old.')
print(f'in {b} years, you will be {(x + b)} years old.')
print(f'in {c} years, you will be {(x + c)} years old.')
print(f'in {d} years, you will be {(x + d)} years old.')

#The book had the same answer except it used age instead of x.  I should have used age to define it better.
