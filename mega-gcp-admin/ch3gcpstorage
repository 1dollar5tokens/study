We have 5 storage options
    persistent storage  
    google cloud storage buckets
    google cloud spanner
    google cloud sql
    google cloud bigtable

Persistent storage
    Persistent storage consist of persistent disks that are durable network storage devices that are mapped to your instance. like virtual hard drives (ssd hdd). They can be resized for more storage

    they are independent of instances(vm)
        data stays on the disk even if you delete the vm it will stay on the disk unless you delete the disk also.
    The data is redundant and optimized for performance
    
    Compute engine is the service the supplies the vm with os
        local and durable storage options
        predefined machine types with specific amounts of vCPU and memory
        custom machine types the allow users to tailor their infrastructure to their workload
        integration with google cloud tech. such as Cloud Storage, App Engine, and Big Query

    Vm's is a computer within a computer that allows users to run diff OS and software on a single physical computer. 
        memory
        network
        CPU
        a hypervisor that manages the resources to ensure that each VM operates efficiently
    
    The compute engine, by default, gets deployed with a disk and contains a operating system(os) 
    You can add more disks if you need them
    Disks are can only exist in only one zone in a region and doesnt expand to multiple zones or   regions

    The vm writes data to the disks 3 times in parallel  to achieve a high rate of redundancy
        consider one persistent disk per partition instead of having multiple partitions on a single persistent disk.  For additional partitions, add additional persistent disks

    IOPS - input/output per second

    if the vm needs high IOPS then consider SSD (solid state drive)

    You can add addition disks during the creation of the vm through click ops

    You can take snapshots of the disk even if the vm is running
