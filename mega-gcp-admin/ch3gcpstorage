We have 5 storage options
    persistent storage  
    google cloud storage buckets
    google cloud spanner
    google cloud sql
    google cloud bigtable

Persistent storage
    Persistent storage consist of persistent disks that are durable network storage devices that are mapped to your instance. like virtual hard drives (ssd hdd). They can be resized for more storage

    they are independent of instances(vm)
        data stays on the disk even if you delete the vm it will stay on the disk unless you delete the disk also.
    The data is redundant and optimized for performance
    
    Compute engine is the service the supplies the vm with os
        local and durable storage options
        predefined machine types with specific amounts of vCPU and memory
        custom machine types the allow users to tailor their infrastructure to their workload
        integration with google cloud tech. such as Cloud Storage, App Engine, and Big Query

    Vm's is a computer within a computer that allows users to run diff OS and software on a single physical computer. 
        memory
        network
        CPU
        a hypervisor that manages the resources to ensure that each VM operates efficiently
    
    The compute engine, by default, gets deployed with a disk and contains a operating system(os) 
    You can add more disks if you need them
    Disks are can only exist in only one zone in a region and doesnt expand to multiple zones or   regions

    The vm writes data to the disks 3 times in parallel  to achieve a high rate of redundancy
        consider one persistent disk per partition instead of having multiple partitions on a single persistent disk.  For additional partitions, add additional persistent disks

    IOPS - input/output per second

    if the vm needs high IOPS then consider SSD (solid state drive)

    You can add addition disks during the creation of the vm through click ops

    You can take snapshots of the disk even if the vm is running
    
    all data is encrypted by the compute engine before it travels outside the vm and is written on the persistent disk.
        each persistent disk is encrypted either by the system defined or customer supplied keys.  Once you delete a persistent disk, Google discards its cipher keys and that data is irretrievable.
    max size of disk 64tb
    most vm's are max 64tb of disk storage space and max of 16 attached disks.
    custom vm's with less than 3.75gb of memory are limited to 3tb of total persistent disk space and a max of 4 attached disks.
    remember that the total persistent disk space of vm's includes te size of the root disk.

            attaching more than 16 disks is available in the beta feature where you can go up to 128 attached persistent disks for perdefined machine types

    another option in persistent disks is the aility to use LOCAL SSDs that are physically attached to the server that hosts the vm.  It gives you disks with higher throughput and lower latency than the standard or ssd(network based) persistent disks
    LOCAL SSDs connect through both SCSI(small computer system interface(plugs)) AND NVMe(non-volatile memory express interface(connects ssd to CPUs or servers using the PCI express(PCIe) bus)) interfaces, using a LOCAL SSD also does not count towards your network egress bandwidth cap

    The catch is that it only last as long as the vm is up and running.  
    Data remains on the local ssd if you reboot the vm or if you live migrate the vm.
        During a live migration, all data from the local ssd is copied to the vm itself and you will notice a performance decrease.  If the instance is stopped or deleted, all data is lost

    Local SSDs need to be manually stripped into a single logical volume to achieve the best performance.
    Each local SSD disk is 375gb in size and you can attach up to 8 local SSD disks to give you a total of 3tb of storage space per vm
